<div style="padding-top:40px;">As it turns out,<br />
there are many completely valid reasons you may want to perform actions during scrolling,<br />
for example parallax effects,<br />
or performance-friendly infinite scroll lists.<br />
And because of Apple’s decision to pause JavaScript during scrolling,<br />
these effects became impossible to do on the mobile web,<br />
at least without implementing scrolling with JavaScript,<br />
which a number of libraries actually do.<br />

For example the popular iScroll library reimplements scrolling using CSS translations to make custom scroll events possible.<br />
Kendo UI Mobile includes a custom scroll widget and uses it to drive its list-based widgets.<br />
To be fair,<br />
these frameworks offer a lot more functionality than simple scroll events,<br />
and the custom JavaScript is usually done to get the best possible performance,<br />
but,<br />
the fact that you have to rebuild scrolling — a basic tenet of a web browser — to get usable scroll events on mobile is…insane.<br />
<br />
And keep in mind that we’re not just talking about the scroll event.<br />
iOS < 8 pauses all JavaScript execution during scrolling.<br />
Therefore,<br />
any intervals you create with setInterval() are also paused.<br />
